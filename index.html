<h1>About Me</h1>
<img class="img_header" src="assets/images/Cat_sml.png" alt="my agent" class="img">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I have thought about creating a work-related website for a while now. This is nothing new. Nowadays, a Google Search will yield domain names from A to Z and everything in between. What is new (for me) is to figure out how to separate professional, social and personal lives when my work, hobbies and values have more or less merged.</p>

<h3>Where I have been</h3>
<p>I have learned textile design, graphic design and instructional design. I am a designer of sorts. I have also taken a bunch of classes in creative writing and information systems. I see patterns in beauty and vice versa. A favorite leisure pursuit of mine, photography, allows me to appreciate how understanding techniques can help me capture images as best as human eyes can see. 

<h3>Where I am</h3>
<p>It is hard to look at a website using only system colors such as intense red on intense blue. The contrast is not sympathetic to the human eyes. But, I have to look pass the superficial facade, to look deeper, to discern between UI and UX. Because, user-friendly interactivity is the main reason people come back to a website. </p>

<h3>Where I Wanna Be</h3>
<p>I would like to create a user-friendly, highly interactive e-Learning website from scratch (not the MIT Scratch), consolidating my design-of-sorts learning and experiences. The looks will be aesthetic but not to distract people from navigating. The contents and interaction will enhance learning. If users also like the design, that will be a bonus!</p>
